==============
Jubako library
==============


What is this ?
==============

Jubako is a new container format, its spec can be found at https://framagit.org/jubako/spec

This repository is the reference implementation (in rust) of Jubako.
This Jubako library is still in early stage development and absolutitly not ready to use.

Reading part is partly done. Parsing of all main structures is done.
Few (optional) structures are missing.

Writing part is NOT done.

Yes, it means that Jubako library is able to read a container format even if
no code is able to create it.

This is the joy of development and early stage.
