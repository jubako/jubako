# Jubako 0.3.3

- Fix compilation of jbk tools when installed from `crates.io` registry.

# Jubako 0.3.2

- Remove `into_usize` methods from `Offset` and `Size`.
- Add new `size`/`offset` methods on `ByteStream`
- Add new module `cmd_utils` which provides usefull helper to parse command line options.
  Behind `clap` feature.
- Update README
- Fix various typos and clippy warnings.

## `jbk` tool

- Use new `graphex` crate to explore Jubako structure instead of custom traits.
  This is not a great change as `graphex` has been created to replace custom traits.
- Display key is bold
- `serde` is optional, even for binary
- Only json and "human" outptu
- `--version` option now include the git commit

# Jubako 0.3.1

Fix compilation on 32 bits.
- Do not check size of rust struct
- Print a warning instead of panic if trying to check a memory block to big to fit in memory.

# Jubako 0.3.0

This is a major update of Jubako.
It introduces breaking changes in the format

## Format

### PackInfo now store a SizedOffset instead of an Offset for CheckInfo

CheckInfo is a variable length structure. When stored at the end of pack, the size can
be inferred from the offset and the total file size.
However when stored in the manifest (to be sure that no other packs), this is not possible,
so PackInfo now stores a SizedOffset.

### ContainerPack is a classic Pack

First version of ContainerPack was using a custom header/tail.
Now `ContainerPack` is as any other packs, it starts/ends with a pack header followed
by a `ContainerPackHeader`.

### Common FreeData

All packs have a free zone to store vendor specific data. Initially, each pack has it owns
free data size. Now, all packs have a same free data size of 24 bytes.

### Introduce a flag in the pack header.

Not used for now, it is planned to use it to mark streamed packs (packs generated without seek)

### Use a CRC32 to check all internal Jubako structures.

Now, all internal Jubako structures are checked with a CRC32.
So, all structures are checked for transfer/storage error before being parsed.
Data in cluster (ContentPack) is not checked.

### Reduce maximal length for entry's metadata array/string

Before that, size could be stored in an u56, so a maximal size of 64 PiB.
Now, size is stored at maximum in an u24, so a maximal size of 16MiB.
This is a more rational size, especially for 32 bits architectures.

## Implementation

### Read 4Kb of data to detect if we must compress data.

Jubako compute the Shannon entropy of the content to detect if it worth to compress it.
Now it read the firsts 4KB of data instead of 1KB.

### Layout structures now use named variables.

Before that layout was composed of tuples.
Now it is structures (with named members) to be more explicit.

### Introduce `MayMissPack`.

On Jubako side, it is normal that a referenced pack is missing.
Before that, a missing pack was handled as a Jubako `Error`.
Now, when accessing content (or contentPack) we return a `Result<MayMissPack<T>>`.
`MayMissPack` is an enum between a `T` and a `PackInfo` (if pack is missing)

### Introduce `BasicCreator`

Creating a Jubako archive need kind of always the same things
(create `ContentPack`, `DirectoryPack`, `ManifestPack` and write them either in separate files
or same files).

Instead of re-implementing this in all downstream libraries (arx, waj, prezpack...) let's factorize
this common steps here.

### Performance improvements

A lot of performance improvement has been made:
- Better manangement of multithreading (thread pool ...)
- Less memory copy
- Use BufWriter in creators

### Introduce `jbk explore` tool

This allow to explore a Jubako container to inspect internal structures:
- Different packs
- Internal structures
- Read data

### Intrudoce `jbk locate` tool

This allow to read and set the location of packs in the manifest packs.
As packs may be stored independently, user need a way to set the location of the packs
in the manifest packs.

### Support 32 bits architecture

Jubako can now be compiled on 32 bits architectures.

### Better low level reader api structures.

While this change simplify a lot internal readers, it changes a bit the public API
by exporting public `ByteRegion`, `ByteSlice` and `ByteStream` instead of `Reader` and `Stream`.

### Reduce number of publicly exported structures.

This reduce the public API surface.

# Jubako 0.2.1

- Use dependency `xz2` instead of `rust-lzma` for lzma compression
- Improved CI

# Jubako 0.2

This is a huge update !!

## Format

### Introduce a common part in entry definition


Instead of having entry being composed of Variants, now entries are composed of a common part
containing all attributes common to all variants and then a variant part with attributes specfic to one variant.

By moving common attributes in a common part, implementation doesn't have to check the variant id before
reading those attributes. We also ensure the attributes are actually the same (which was not the case between variants),
so we only need one builder.

### Introduce a pack tail

The pack tail is a copy of the pack header, bytes swapped.
This allow reader to open a pack "by the end".
This way, we can prepend any content to a pack file and still have a valid pack.

This is especially usefull to create auto-(extractible|moutable|servable) content by concatening
a binary trying to open itself and a Jubako container.


### Introduce deported value store

Value store was already existing to store variable length attribute (in a by nature fixed length entry).
Now, it is possible to store any integer attribute in deported value store.

It is usefull for attribute composed of few big value.
For example, file owner in a arx archive is a integer around `1000`, `1001`... and so need two bytes of storage
per entry. By moving the value in a value store, we only have to store the index in the store and so, we need only one byte of storage.


### Introduce default value

If all entries have the same value for an attribute, we can now store this value directly in the entry layout.
Nothing is stored in the entry itself.
For example, file's owner in an arx archive is probably always the same (`1000`). By storing this value in the layout, we need
zero byte storage per entry.

### Allow the pack_id to be stored in a u16

By storing the pack_id in a u16, we are not limited to 256 packs.
This open the doors to Jubako container composed of a lots of packs (delta packs, regrouped packs, ...)

### Variable size content address

ContentAddress are not always 4 bytes. The content id can now be stored using 1, 2 or 3 bytes.
If all pack_id are the same, it will be stored direcly in the layout to earn one or two bytes per entries.

### Names for attributes and variants

Attributes and variants are now named. Instead of accessible them using a index, they can (and must) be accessed using
a name.

- Better self descriptible layout
- Implementation are more tollerent to compatibility issue as implementation can know if a attributes/variants is present
  in a container or not.

### Introduce ContainerPack

Content pack was stored in manifest pack.
Now, manifest pack do not contain other packs but just reference them.
New container pack now contains other packs (including manifest pack).

This allow a better regroupement of pack as two content packs can now regroup together, even without manifest pack.

This also allow better sharing of content pack between container as manifest can link to another container pack in which
we will search for content pack.

### Move to little endian

By moving to little endian, we are closer to most common hardware implementation and we have a lot less bytes swap.

## Implementation

### API

Well... almost everything has changed. Hopefully, no one but me was using this API.
And tools as arx and waj are already ported.
Sorry but I will not explain every structure renaming here :)

### Cache

Structure as ValueStore and EntryStore are now cached.
We don't recreate (and parse) stores at each request/api call.

### Check tool

Add a tool to check packs, using checksum stored in packs.

### Value store now avoid storing duplicated data

If two entries use the same value (and a value store), they now point to the same value instead
of adding twice the value to the value store.

### Do not compress all data

Based on shannon entropy, we decide if we must compress data or not.

### Compress cluster in different threads

This greatly improve creation time.

### Uncompress content in differnt threads

Instead of doing partial decompression in the main thread, we now do full decompression in background
decompression thread.

- Main thread now return as soon as we have started to decompress content, not when the content is decompressed.
- We decompress the whole cluster, so next read has more chance to read already ready content. (yes, a lot of "read" here)
- As we don't store the decompression context, we use less memory.
- We still allow reading of the partially decompressed content while rest of the cluster is decompressed.

### Sort entry and value store in parallel

Rayon help here to sort our stores.

### Use binary search to locate entry

When entries are sorted in the store, we now use binary search to locate them.
We go from `O(n)` to `O(log(n))`

### Jubako structures are now `Sync` and `Send`

You can share your structure between threads.

### Use stable rust

Jubako now use stable rust. No need for nightly rust and unsteable features.


### Countless speed and memory optimization

Countless I've said !!
